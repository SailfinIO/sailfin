// Basic variable declarations
let x: number = 42;
let y: number = 10;

// Arithmetic operations
let sum: number = x + y;
let product: number = x * y;
let difference: number = x - y;
let quotient: number = x / y;

// Conditional logic
if (sum > 50) {
    let message: string = "Sum is greater than 50";
    let doubled: number = sum * 2;
}

// Comparison operations
let isEqual: number = x == y;
let isNotEqual: number = x != y;
let isGreater: number = x > y;
let isLess: number = x < y;

// Nested conditionals
if (x > 30) {
    if (y < 20) {
        let nested: number = x + y;
    } else {
        let alternative: number = x - y;
    }
}

// Complex expressions
let complex: number = (x + y) * (x - y);
let comparison: number = (x * 2) > (y + 30);
