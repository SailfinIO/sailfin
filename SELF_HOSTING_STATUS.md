# Sailfin Self-Hosting Status

## 🎯 Current Status: **Alpha Self-Hosting**

The Sailfin programming language has successfully achieved **self-hosting compilation**! The compiler can now compile itself from Sailfin source code to produce a working compiler binary.

## ✅ Completed Milestones

### Phase 1: Bootstrap Compiler ✓

- [x] Python-based bootstrap compiler
- [x] Lexical analysis and parsing
- [x] AST generation and validation
- [x] Code generation to Python
- [x] Module system and imports
- [x] Example compilation and testing

### Phase 2: Self-Hosting Foundation ✓

- [x] Self-hosting compiler written in Sailfin
- [x] ARM64 assembly code generation
- [x] Basic function declarations and calls
- [x] Compiler can compile itself
- [x] Automated build system
- [x] CI/CD pipeline with multi-platform builds

### Phase 3: Build & Release System ✓

- [x] Complete build pipeline (`build.sh`)
- [x] One-line installer (`install.sh`)
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [x] Multi-platform release packages
- [x] Branch-based pre-releases (alpha, beta, rc)

## 🏆 Self-Hosting Achievement

As of **July 2025**, Sailfin has achieved true self-hosting:

1. **Bootstrap Phase**: Python compiler compiles Sailfin source
2. **Self-Compilation**: Sailfin compiler compiles itself
3. **Native Output**: Generates working ARM64 assembly
4. **Automated**: Full CI/CD pipeline with releases

This places Sailfin among the ranks of other self-hosting languages like Go, Rust, and C++.

## 🎉 Try It Now!

```bash
# Install Sailfin
curl -sSL https://github.com/sailfin/sailfin/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# Write your first program
echo 'fn main() -> void { print.info("Self-hosting works! 🚢"); }' > selfhost.sfn

# Compile and run
sfn selfhost.sfn
```

The future of Sailfin is bright! Join us in building the next generation of self-hosting programming languages. 🚢
