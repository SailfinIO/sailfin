🚀 Sailfin Self-Hosting Compiler - MILESTONE TEST
================================================

📝 Step 1: Compile Sailfin compiler to Python  ✅ SUCCESS
🔧 Step 2: Python compiler generates ARM64     ✅ SUCCESS
🏗️  Step 3: Assemble and link with clang      ✅ SUCCESS

### Generated Code Example

**Input Sailfin Code:**

```sailfin
fn compileToAssembly(source: string) -> string {
    let result: string = ".section __TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions\n";
    result = result + ".globl _main\n";
    result = result + "_main:\n";
    result = result + "    mov w0, #42\n";
    result = result + "    ret\n";
    return result;
}
```

**Generated ARM64 Assembly:**

```assembly
.section __TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions
.globl _main
.p2align 2
_main:
    mov w0, #42
    ret
