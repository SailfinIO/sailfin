### Language Features Supported

#### ✅ Data Types & Variables
```sailfin
let x: number = 42;        // Immutable variable
mut y: number = 10;        // Mutable variable
y = y + x;                 // Assignment to mutable variable
```

#### ✅ Variable Mutability System
```sailfin
let constant: number = 100;  // Cannot be changed
mut counter: number = 0;     // Can be changed
counter = counter + 1;       // Valid assignment
// constant = 200;           // Compile error!
```

#### ✅ Arithmetic Expressions
```sailfin
let result: number = (x + y) * (x - y);
```

#### ✅ Comparison Operations
```sailfin
let isEqual: number = x == y;
let isGreater: number = x > 45;
```

#### ✅ Conditional Statements
```sailfin
if (x > 30) {
    let nested: number = x * 2;
} else {
    let alternative: number = x / 2;
}
```

#### ✅ Function Declarations & Calls
```sailfin
fn add(x: number, y: number) -> number {
    return x + y;
}

fn main() -> void {
    let result: number = add(10, 20);
}
```

#### ✅ While Loops  
```sailfin
mut i: number = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    print("Iteration: " + i.toString());
    i = i + 1;
}
```

#### ✅ String Literals and Print  
```sailfin
let message: string = "Hello, Sailfin!";
print(message);
print("Hello, World!");
```

#### ✅ Array Literals and Indexing
```sailfin
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first: number = numbers[0];
let third: number = numbers[2];
```

#### ✅ Complex Expressions
```sailfin
let complex: number = (x + 10) > (y * 2);
```

### Technical Architecture

#### ✅ Self-Hosting Pipeline
```
Sailfin Source (.sfn)
        ↓
    Lexer (Sailfin) → Tokens
        ↓
    Parser (Sailfin) → AST
        ↓
    CodeGen (Sailfin) → ARM64 Assembly
        ↓
    Assembler/Linker → Native Executable
```

#### ✅ Native Code Generation
- **Target**: ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Output**: Standard ARM64 assembly
- **Calling Convention**: ARM64 AAPCS
- **Stack Management**: Proper frame pointer usage
- **Register Allocation**: Efficient register usage

## 🔧 Build & Test Process

### Building Generated Code
```bash
# Generate assembly from Sailfin source
./sailfin_compiler source.sfn > output.s

# Assemble and link
clang -c output.s -o output.o
clang -o output output.o

# Run
./output
```

### Example Generated Code
Input:
```sailfin
let x: number = 42;
let y: number = x + 8;
```

Output (ARM64 Assembly):
```assembly
.section __TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions
.globl _main
.p2align 2
_main:
    sub sp, sp, #32
    stp x29, x30, [sp, #16]
    add x29, sp, #16
    mov w8, #42
    str w8, [x29, #-4]
    ldr w8, [x29, #-4]
    add w8, w8, #8
    str w8, [x29, #-8]
    mov w0, #0
    ldp x29, x30, [sp, #16]
