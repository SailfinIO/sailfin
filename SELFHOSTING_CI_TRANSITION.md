# Sailfin Self-Hosting CI/CD Transition

## Overview

This document outlines the complete transition from the Python bootstrap-based CI/CD pipeline to a fully self-hosting Sailfin CI/CD system.

## üîÑ Transition Summary

### Before (Bootstrap-based)

- **Primary Compiler**: Python bootstrap (`bootstrap/bootstrap.py`)
- **CI Pipeline**: `.github/workflows/sailfin-ci.yml` (bootstrap-focused)
- **Release Process**: `.github/workflows/bootstrap-release.yml`
- **Artifacts**: PyInstaller-packaged Python binary
- **Testing**: Bootstrap compiler with 69 examples

### After (Self-hosting)

- **Primary Compiler**: Self-hosting Sailfin binary (`build/sfn`)
- **CI Pipeline**: `.github/workflows/sailfin-ci.yml` (self-hosting focused)
- **Release Process**: `.github/workflows/sailfin-release.yml`
- **Artifacts**: Native Sailfin binary (no Python dependencies)
- **Testing**: Self-hosting compiler with same 69 examples

## üöÄ New CI/CD Pipeline

### Main CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/sailfin-ci.yml`)

**Jobs:**

1. **`setup-compiler`**: Downloads official self-hosting binary OR builds from source
2. **`test-examples`**: Tests all 69 examples with self-hosting compiler
3. **`test-cross-platform`**: Verifies compilation on Linux and macOS
4. **`benchmark`**: Performance comparison vs bootstrap

**Key Features:**

- ‚úÖ **Smart Fallback**: Uses official release binary when available, builds from source otherwise
- ‚úÖ **Self-Hosting Verification**: Compiler compiles itself (`sfn compiler/compiler.sfn`)
- ‚úÖ **Complete Testing**: All 69 examples tested with native compiler
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Linux and macOS support

### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/sailfin-release.yml`)

**Jobs:**

1. **`build-release`**: Builds self-hosting compiler for Linux and macOS
2. **`create-release`**: Creates GitHub release with platform-specific packages
3. **`update-docs`**: Updates README with latest release information

**Artifacts:**

- `sailfin-linux-x64.tar.gz` - Linux binary package
- `sailfin-macos-x64.tar.gz` - macOS binary package
- `install.sh` - Universal installation script

## üì¶ Self-Hosting Build Process

### Build Script (`build-self-hosting-new.sh`)

```bash
# Primary build method - self-hosting
./build-self-hosting-new.sh build
```

**Process:**

1. **Bootstrap Check**: Uses existing `build/sfn` if available
2. **Self-Compilation**: Compiles `compiler/compiler.sfn` with itself
3. **Fallback**: Uses Python bootstrap only for initial build
4. **Verification**: Tests resulting binary on examples

### Testing (`bootstrap/test_all_examples.py`)

```bash
# Prefers self-hosting compiler automatically
python test_all_examples.py

# Force bootstrap for comparison
python test_all_examples.py --force-bootstrap
```

**Smart Compiler Selection:**

1. Checks for `build/sfn` (self-hosting binary)
2. Falls back to `bootstrap.py` if needed
3. Reports which compiler is being used

## üóÇÔ∏è File Changes

### New Files

- `.github/workflows/sailfin-release.yml` - Self-hosting release workflow
- `build-self-hosting-new.sh` - Robust self-hosting build script
- `test-ci-local.sh` - Local CI testing script
- `SELFHOSTING_CI_TRANSITION.md` - This document

### Updated Files

- `.github/workflows/sailfin-ci.yml` - Now self-hosting focused
- `bootstrap/test_all_examples.py` - Prefers self-hosting compiler
- `README.md` - Updated badges, install instructions, build process
- `install.sh` - Already configured for self-hosting releases

### Deprecated Files

- `.github/workflows/bootstrap-release.yml` - Marked as deprecated
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Marked as deprecated
- `.github/workflows/sailfin-selfhosting-ci.yml` - Replaced by main CI

## üéØ Benefits of Self-Hosting CI

### For Users

- **No Python Dependencies**: Native binary, no Python/Poetry required
- **Faster Installation**: Direct binary download vs Python package
- **True Self-Hosting**: Proves language maturity and capability
- **Better Performance**: Native compilation vs interpreted Python

### For Development

- **Dogfooding**: Using our own compiler catches real-world issues
- **Validation**: Self-compilation proves compiler correctness
- **Performance Monitoring**: Direct comparison with bootstrap
- **Release Confidence**: Every release verified to be self-hosting

## üß™ Testing and Verification

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test the new CI pipeline locally
./test-ci-local.sh
```

### CI Verification

- All 69 examples must pass with self-hosting compiler
- Compiler must be able to compile itself
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
- Performance benchmarks collected

### Release Verification

- Self-hosting binary packages created for each platform
- Universal install script works across platforms
- Documentation updated with latest release info

## üîÆ Future Improvements

### Short Term

- Windows support for self-hosting binary
- ARM64 native compilation for Apple Silicon
- Performance optimizations in self-hosting compiler

### Long Term

- Language server protocol (LSP) implementation
- Package manager using self-hosting compiler
- IDE integrations and syntax highlighting
- Expanded standard library

## üìã Migration Checklist

- [x] Create new self-hosting CI workflow
- [x] Update main CI to use self-hosting compiler
- [x] Create self-hosting release workflow
- [x] Deprecate old bootstrap workflows
- [x] Update test script to prefer self-hosting
- [x] Update README with self-hosting status
- [x] Create build script for self-hosting
- [x] Create local testing script
- [x] Document the transition process

## üö¢ Conclusion

The transition to self-hosting CI/CD represents a major milestone for Sailfin. The language has achieved true self-hosting capability and can now use its own compiler as the primary build and release artifact. This transition proves the language's maturity and provides users with a native, dependency-free compiler experience.

**The bootstrap served its purpose and successfully launched Sailfin into self-hosting orbit! üöÄ**
